<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
