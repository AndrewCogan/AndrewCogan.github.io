There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). When you contact us to schedule your visit, ask how long the inspection generally takes.</p>
