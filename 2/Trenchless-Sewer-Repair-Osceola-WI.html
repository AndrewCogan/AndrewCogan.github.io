<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Numerous homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to utilize and inexpensive, but they damage your pipes and their effects are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly advised.</p>
