<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles.

As it gets worn, it can start to crack and solidify or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
