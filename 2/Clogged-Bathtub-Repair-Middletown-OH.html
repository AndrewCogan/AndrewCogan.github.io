<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked yearly. Also allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested every year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
