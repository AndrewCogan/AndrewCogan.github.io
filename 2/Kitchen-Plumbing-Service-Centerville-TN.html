<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are ending up being more and more typical, as both manufacturers and customers look for new ways to save water. Dual flush toilets allow the user to pick the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is solid or liquid. We've all heard the old adage, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - and so the double flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just using less water to do it.</p>
