<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Audubon NJ</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
