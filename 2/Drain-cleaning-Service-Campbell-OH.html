<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Campbell OH</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
