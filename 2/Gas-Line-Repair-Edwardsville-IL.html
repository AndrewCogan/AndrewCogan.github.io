<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to lower these symptoms.</p>
<p>Have your assistant hold the flange in place while you position yourself below the sink or lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on top to prevent it from moving.
