<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
