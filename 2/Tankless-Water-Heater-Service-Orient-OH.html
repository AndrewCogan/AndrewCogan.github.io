We highly recommend repiping your home during spring or summer season so you do not have to fret about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment. Usually, if the issue is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is likely the best option. When more than one drain is sluggish or clogged, it can suggest a larger issue with your plumbing system.
