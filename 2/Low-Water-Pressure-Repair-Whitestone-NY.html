The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
