The majority of pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship.

Technical direction consists of security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. The majority of apprentices go into a program straight, however some start as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
