The efficiency of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the house, discover out. Homes that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan.
