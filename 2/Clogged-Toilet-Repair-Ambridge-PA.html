<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have failed. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended time period." Call your insurance agent and confirm your coverage. Double check with your representative to validate that your understanding is proper when you have checked out through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
<p>With drain line cleaning, you know your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you know they're in good condition. And with lining, you know they'll be protected for years to come.
