<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
