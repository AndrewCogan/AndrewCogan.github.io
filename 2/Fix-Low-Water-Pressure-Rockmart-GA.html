But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
