<p>Water softeners usually use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Disc: Found in both restrooms and cooking areas, disc faucets are recognizable by a single lever which carries on a broad, cylindrical body.
