<p>Making sure plumbing devices such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is imperative in order to maintain drinkable water safety. Read our reviews to see what individuals are saying about our water heater services.

A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
