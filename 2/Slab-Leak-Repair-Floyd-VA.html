<p>To assist avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the approach laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly true when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
