<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of desired usages around your house.</p>
