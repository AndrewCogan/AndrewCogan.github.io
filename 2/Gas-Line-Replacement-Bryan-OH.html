<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
