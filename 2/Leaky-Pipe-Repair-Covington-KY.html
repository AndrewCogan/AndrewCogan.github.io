Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
