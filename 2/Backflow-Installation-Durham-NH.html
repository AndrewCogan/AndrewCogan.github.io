Ever since we initially opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a difference in the lives of numerous house owners in North America and worldwide. Our premium system, the EC4 entire home water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that uses a process of ion exchange to get rid of the minerals that trigger tough water. By changing the bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium ions that cause water solidity with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by resolving its source. Furthermore, thanks to its special, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water use patterns, adjusting its soft water shipment based on your needs. In this way, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an endless supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Difficult water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
