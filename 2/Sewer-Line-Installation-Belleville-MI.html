Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked annually to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
