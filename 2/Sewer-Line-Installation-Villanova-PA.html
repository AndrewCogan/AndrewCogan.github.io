<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
