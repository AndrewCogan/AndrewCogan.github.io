The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
