<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is essential to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be impractical in numerous scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
