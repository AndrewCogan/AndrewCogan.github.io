<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Albuquerque NM</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>A toilet that runs non-stop is frustrating, however it can also cost you a great deal of money. Without toilet repair, it resembles you're flushing cash down the toilet!
