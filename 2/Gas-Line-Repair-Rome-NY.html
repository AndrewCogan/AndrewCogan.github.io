<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin areas leak right now and often those leaks come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
