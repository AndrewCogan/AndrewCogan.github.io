Read our evaluations to see what individuals are stating about our water heater services. It may be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last few years. A great general rule for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>

A vacuum breaker must be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser needs to be strongly attached to durable rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is considerably total is restricted unless a check backflow assembly is installed and right away evaluated to assure it is working.</p>
