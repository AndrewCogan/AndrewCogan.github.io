A research study conducted in 2009 by the Water Quality Research Foundation in conjunction with the Battelle Memorial Institute, referred to as The Battelle Research study, conducted tests to help identify just how much energy savings a whole house water softener can provide house owners.

<p>The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to fix the concern. Other times a more substantial solution is needed: repiping. PVB assembles, meant for lawn irrigation, are the least pricey type of whole-system backflow preventer. They are reasonably basic in style and the simplest to install, preserve, and repair.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
