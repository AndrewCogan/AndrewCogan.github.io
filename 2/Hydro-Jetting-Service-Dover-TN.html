If you are not sure how old your system is, you should have the ability to get that details from the serial number on the producer's sticker label (usually near the top of the system). Normally, the very first two numbers show the year of your water heater.</p>

Unbreakable Blockages: Professional assistance is the very best solution, if you find yourself provided with a specifically stubborn clog.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
