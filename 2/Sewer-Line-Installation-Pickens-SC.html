<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
