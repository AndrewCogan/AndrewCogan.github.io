Once a person ends up being a certified tester, there is a good chance the individual understands how to test a backflow preventer. Sadly, this does not suggest the person understands how to repair a backflow preventer. Lot of times it is presumed if you can check them, you can repair them. This is not real.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
