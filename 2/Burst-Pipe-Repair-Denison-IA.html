<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
