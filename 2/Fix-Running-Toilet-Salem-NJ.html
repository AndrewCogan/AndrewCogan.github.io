<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
