<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
