<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated yearly to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
