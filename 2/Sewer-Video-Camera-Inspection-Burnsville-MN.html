Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your everyday routine. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and particles. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then remove and replace them, leaving as much of the original structure material as possible undamaged.</p>
