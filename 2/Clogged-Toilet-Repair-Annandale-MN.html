<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never precisely matches supply.
