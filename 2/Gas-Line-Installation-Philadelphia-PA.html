<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
