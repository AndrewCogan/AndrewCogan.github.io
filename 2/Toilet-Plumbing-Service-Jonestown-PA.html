<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Jonestown PA?</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
