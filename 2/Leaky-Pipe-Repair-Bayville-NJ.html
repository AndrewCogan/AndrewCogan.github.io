Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply years of security. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its performance.
