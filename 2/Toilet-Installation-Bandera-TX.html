<p>An rdc is similar to a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it normally does not include shutoff valves, may or may not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be used to isolate just nonhealth threats and is intended for use just in water service connections to single-family homes.</p>
