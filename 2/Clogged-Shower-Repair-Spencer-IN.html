<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
