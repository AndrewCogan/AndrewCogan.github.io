<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
