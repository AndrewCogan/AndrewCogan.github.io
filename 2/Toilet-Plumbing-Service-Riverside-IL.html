<p>Our process starts with an inspection of the different problems faced by the homeowner, this is followed by one of our extensive team of professionals placing a camera into the drains to recognize the blocked area and identify how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain implied a snake would be used to pierce a hole in the drain to allow a small amount of wastewater to travel through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
