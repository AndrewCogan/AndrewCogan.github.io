<p>Our process starts with an inspection of the different problems faced by the homeowner, this is followed by one of our extensive team of professionals placing a camera into the drains to recognize the blocked area and identify how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain implied a snake would be used to pierce a hole in the drain to allow a small amount of wastewater to travel through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
