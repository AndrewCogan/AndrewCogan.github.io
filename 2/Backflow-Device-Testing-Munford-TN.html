When the tank leakages, your water heater is dead. The telltale sign that your hot water heater needs replacing is a slow drip underneath, typically appearing as a trail of rusty water. This means that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other signs, such as inadequate or no hot water, generally signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

In a separate drain pathway, small pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a larger one below the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A terrific way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit.
