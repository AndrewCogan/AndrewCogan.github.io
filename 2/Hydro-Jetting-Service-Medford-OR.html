<p>A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell. From brand-new bathroom fixtures to custom counter tops, we truly have all of it. Our stock makes us the best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.
