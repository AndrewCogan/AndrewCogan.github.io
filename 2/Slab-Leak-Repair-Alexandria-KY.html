<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
