<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outside if either check valve need to leak.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
