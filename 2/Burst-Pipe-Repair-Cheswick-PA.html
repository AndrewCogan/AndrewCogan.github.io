Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things in a different way could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with drinkable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and watering, you are likewise needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
