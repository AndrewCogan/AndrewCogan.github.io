<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Design template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stay with any surface area in your house, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.
