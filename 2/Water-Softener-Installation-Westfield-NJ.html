<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older house (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an option to consider. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
<h3>Hose Bib Repair in Westfield New Jersey</h2>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
