<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
