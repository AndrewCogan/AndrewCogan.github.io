<p>She learnt about the service call fee. The 4 In Your Corner Examination discovered that's a typical charge. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement.

All of them wanted to look at the situation before dedicating to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
