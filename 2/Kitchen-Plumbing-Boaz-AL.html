Assess the sewer lines from residential or commercial property to curb connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to completely inspect if pipe damage, corrosion, or major blockages exist. Tree roots are one of the biggest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can cause clogs and back up into your home.</p>
<p>In the past, water heater replacement was a basic process: when a water heater finally stopped working, it was replaced with a similar design. Today, new hot water heater installation is a chance to assess your house's existing and future warm water needs so you can select a system that will deliver not just the warm water you need however the energy performance you prefer.
