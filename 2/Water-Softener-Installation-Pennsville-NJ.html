<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Pennsville NJ</h3>
<p>For the purpose of water treatment, hardness is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert in between gpg and ppm use the list below factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm. Additionally, milligrams per litre is comparable to parts per million and can be utilized synonymously.</p>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
