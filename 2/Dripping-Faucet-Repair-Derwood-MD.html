This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
