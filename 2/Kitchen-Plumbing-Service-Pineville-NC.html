<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Pineville NC</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
