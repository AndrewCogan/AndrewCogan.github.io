<p>You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its task quite well, gradually, it still does rust. If you are presently experiencing clogged drains, we can assist! When several of your drains are clogged, water will typically start to back up into your sink, which can lead to weird smells. A blocked drain can also cause problems when flushing the toilet and lead to other drain issues, like water leaks and rupturing pipes.</p>
<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
