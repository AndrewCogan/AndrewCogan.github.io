An authorized, correctly installed and preserved backflow assembly basically removes the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity.

<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically becomes destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time.

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
