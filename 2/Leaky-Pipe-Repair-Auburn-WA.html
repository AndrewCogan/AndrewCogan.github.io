<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
