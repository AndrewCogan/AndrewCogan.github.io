<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside if either check valve ought to leak. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
<p>No hot water - The most obvious indication that your water heater is malfunctioning is a lack of hot water originating from the tap. You may also observe a more steady decline in performance, as the water might take longer to heat up, or you may not have hot water for as long as typical when you are showering or doing the dishes. Not just is an absence of warm water a huge annoyance, but it might also lead to higher gas or electric costs considering that your system is likely utilizing more energy to work with a reduced performance.</p>
