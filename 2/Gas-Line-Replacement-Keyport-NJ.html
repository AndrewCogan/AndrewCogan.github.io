This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
