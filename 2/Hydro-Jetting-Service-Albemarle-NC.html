Accessibility - If the toilet remains in a hard-to-reach area, having access to pipes and even the space behind the tank is restricted, so repairs could cost more. A plumber charges $77 per hour (on average), so anything you can do to make repairs easier, the lower the bill.</p>
<p>Capacity. Capability is crucial in selecting the right water heater for your house. A leading factor in properly sizing your hot water heater is the FHR (first-hour score) is the number of gallons of warm water that the hot water heater can provide in an hour when the tank is complete. If the hot water heater tank is too small, you won't have sufficient hot water to satisfy your requirements. It will heat more water than you use which increases your energy use and energy bills if it is over-sized. Call Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to learn what size fits your needs and to install the right hot water heater in your home.</p>
