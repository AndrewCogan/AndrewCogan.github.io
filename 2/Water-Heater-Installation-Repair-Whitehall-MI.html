In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
