With numerous makes and designs to choose from, it can be difficult to understand where to begin. Are you having problem with a drain issue?

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity though, making sure your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small daily hassles - that many people just cope with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a bad seal.</p>
