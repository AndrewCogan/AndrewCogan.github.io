<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the magnificence in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and wiggle and often even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity though, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little daily hassles - that most people just cope with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
<p>It's an excellent concept to evaluate your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your watering system on. However, we hardly ever suggest CPVC when an entire home needs repiping.
