<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked every year to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
