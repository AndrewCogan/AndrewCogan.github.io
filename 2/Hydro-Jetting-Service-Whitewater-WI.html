<p>You might be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the very same thing, but without the zinc finishing.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
<p>Although the service technician agreed that the customer did the right thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had actually become extremely corroded throughout the years which a PVC pipe might be much better matched for the client's needs. He switched off the water supply to the house, removed the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the residence, the professional restored water circulation and tested the pipe.</p>
