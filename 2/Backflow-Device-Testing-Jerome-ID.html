<p>Property owners frequently ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-effective. The response depends on your home. While gas designs are more economical to operate, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electric water heater is normally lower, but it can be more costly to run. Electric varieties are also much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.
