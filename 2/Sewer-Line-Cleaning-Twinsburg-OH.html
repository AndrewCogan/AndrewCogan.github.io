<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Twinsburg OH</h3>

It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
