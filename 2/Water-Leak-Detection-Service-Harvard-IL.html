<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated annually to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
