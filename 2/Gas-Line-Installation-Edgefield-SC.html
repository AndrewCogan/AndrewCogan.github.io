<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Did You Know that if you are preparing a house redesigning task and plan to repair, replace or include new plumbing, you are required to protect a plumbing permit. In turn, if you are working with a licensed plumbing company they too must secure a permit. A Plumbing permit will offer you with a security inspection; which will insure that the work was done according to code. It is not worth your family's safety and or financial risk to skip this really vital part of your job.</p>
