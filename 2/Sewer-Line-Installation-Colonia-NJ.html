<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
<p>The term tough water" might seem like an oxymoron, but it's merely household water which contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They also are reasonably undetectable through smell or taste, but they can be hazardous simply the exact same. Similar to our trenchless services, we will initially conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel pipes are ideal for watering and water supply lines, but they are normally not utilized in new building and constructions today.
