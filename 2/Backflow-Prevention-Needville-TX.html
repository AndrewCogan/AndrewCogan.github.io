<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
