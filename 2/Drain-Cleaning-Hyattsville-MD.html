The flapper isn't sealing under typical pressure if pushing down on the flapper stops the sound. Turn off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and then run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat.

If cleaning the flush valve seat doesn't resolve the problem, you need to replace the flapper.</p>
<p>If you start to notice lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this could be an indication of rust and mineral accumulation which will gradually begin to block the circulation of water through your pipes.

A modern community water supply system is designed to ensure that water streams to homes and buildings under pressure. This community water network includes numerous users where there is a threat to public health if there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and an infected source.
