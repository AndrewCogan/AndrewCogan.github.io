<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Latonia KY</h3>
<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, obviously, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drains. However, it includes a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly small round device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Likewise allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked yearly to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
