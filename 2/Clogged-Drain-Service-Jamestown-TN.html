<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Professionals Since 1938. You'll discover the difference the first time you shower or shower with softened water. Soft water feels significantly smooth to the skin. It also makes your home easy to clean by reducing hard-water build-up. High water pressure likewise damages plumbing.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
