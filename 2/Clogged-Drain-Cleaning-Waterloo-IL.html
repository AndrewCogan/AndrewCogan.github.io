It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
