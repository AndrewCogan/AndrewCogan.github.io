<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
