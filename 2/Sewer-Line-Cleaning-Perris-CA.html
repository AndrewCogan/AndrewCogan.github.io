A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to land fills and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially susceptible to repeating pinhole leaks (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish deterioration on copper piping.

All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
