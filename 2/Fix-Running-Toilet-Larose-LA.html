<p>If you are upgrading your gas appliances, you should upgrade the piping too. Gas leaks can be scary and harmful. We're here for you every action of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to set up an appointment. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have actually vastly reduced the number of reported incidents that occur within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever truly have been an issue in the very first place. This thinking can be both dangerous and detrimental. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the proper security.</p>
