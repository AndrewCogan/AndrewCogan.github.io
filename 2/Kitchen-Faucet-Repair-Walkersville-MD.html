Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain pipes should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be used to achieve this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
