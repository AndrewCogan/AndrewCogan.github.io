Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
