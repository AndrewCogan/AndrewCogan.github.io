<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
