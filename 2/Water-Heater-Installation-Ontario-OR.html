<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to discover what a affordable and reasonable cost would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
