<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Sebastopol CA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>A. We strongly recommend a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, thus minimizing the danger of contamination of your water source. Many municipalities require the use of an authorized backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You may want to contact your local municipality before installing your irrigation system.</p>
