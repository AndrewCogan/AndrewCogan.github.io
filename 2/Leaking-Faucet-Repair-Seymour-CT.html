<p>Main sewer repair involves comprehensive excavation, supporting supporting walls, removing and passing on pipe and connections, backfilling, and setting up plates for short-term cover.

Off-road tasks outside the right of way require a good deal of manual labor for excavation and transporting products, rock, and dirt to and from the website.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
