<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
