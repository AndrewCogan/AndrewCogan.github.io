<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
