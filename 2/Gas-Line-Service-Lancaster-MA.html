If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your house was developed decades before that.</p>
