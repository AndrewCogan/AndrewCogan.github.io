A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
