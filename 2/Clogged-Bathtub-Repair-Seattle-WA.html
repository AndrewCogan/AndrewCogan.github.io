<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Seattle WA</h3>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be fixed easily if the clog is basic and shallow. For many clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this doesn't fix the problem then you may also need to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>The other distinction between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not all at once like a constant feed waste disposal unit.
