Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water really needs it. Newer units use digital sensing units that monitor bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water use and for that reason only regenerate when needed. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
