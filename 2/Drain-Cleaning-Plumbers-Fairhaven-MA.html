<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked every year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated every year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
