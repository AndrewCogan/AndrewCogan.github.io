<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's potable water supply is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system differ "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water entering the potable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic material, which suggests bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (along with PVC pipes) considering that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is particularly useful for hot and cold faucet water and refrigerant lines in HVAC systems.</p>
