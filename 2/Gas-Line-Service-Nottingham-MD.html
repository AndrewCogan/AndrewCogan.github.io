<p>Lastly, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or non-health threats.</p>
