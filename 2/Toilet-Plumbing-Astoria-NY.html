<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might happen.
