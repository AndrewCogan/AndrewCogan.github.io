<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Supply NC</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>And depending upon the configuration of your home, the plumber might have the ability to access the large bulk of your system by doing this. For a 1,500 square-foot, two-bathroom house, you'll pay between $2,000 and $6,000 or more to replace just the exposed plumbing. Having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is important since you have to move quickly in the face of a gas leak. Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has service technicians thoroughly trained to find the place of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending upon the severity of the leak.</p>
