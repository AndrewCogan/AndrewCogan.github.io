<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
