<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project.
