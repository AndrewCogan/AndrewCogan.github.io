<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Davenport FL</h3>
<p>Close all outside windows and doors and turn on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a neighboring hot water faucet until you hear the burner in the hot water heater spark. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke does not draw. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem.</p>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
