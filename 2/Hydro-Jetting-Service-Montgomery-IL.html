<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
