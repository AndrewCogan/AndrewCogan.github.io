<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
