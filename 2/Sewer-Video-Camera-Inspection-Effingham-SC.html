<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but needs to then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that need to be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized coating (which is essentially a special paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
