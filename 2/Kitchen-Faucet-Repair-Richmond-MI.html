<h3>Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Richmond MI</h3>

Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
