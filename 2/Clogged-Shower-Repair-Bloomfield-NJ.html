<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Bloomfield NJ</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
