<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I love to prepare, I create a lot of meals. We set up a short-lived workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely utilize this company once again and again in the future.</p>
