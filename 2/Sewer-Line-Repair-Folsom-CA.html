<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Folsom CA</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal.

(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop.
