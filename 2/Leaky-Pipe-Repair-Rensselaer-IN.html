<h3>When To Call A Plumber Rensselaer IN</h3>
<p>Close all outside windows and doors and switch on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet until you hear the burner in the water heater fire up. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the problem.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning parts: If you have an electrical water heater, a faulty thermostat or a tripped breaker can trigger problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot light might go out, resulting in little or no warm water. In general, traditional water heaters are expected to last 7-10 years with correct maintenance. Inspect the age of the existing water heater if you're moving into a new house. You don't wish to move into a brand-new home only to discover you're going to have to make a major plumbing repair in just a year or two.</p>
