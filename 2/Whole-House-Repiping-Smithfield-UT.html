Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a durable and exceptional alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in location for several hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
