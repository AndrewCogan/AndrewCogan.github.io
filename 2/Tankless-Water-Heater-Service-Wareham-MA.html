Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. Many apprentices enter a program directly, but some start as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>

Such concerns likewise factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of use.</p>
