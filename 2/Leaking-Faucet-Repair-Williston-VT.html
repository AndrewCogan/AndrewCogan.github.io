After finishing your high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) in some cases, you might want to think about participating in a plumbing apprenticeship program.

Typically, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
