Our specialists will fix your clogged drains and supply additional sink repair if required.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
