<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Charlottesville VA</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
