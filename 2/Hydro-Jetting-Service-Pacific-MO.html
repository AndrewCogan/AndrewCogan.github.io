<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Pacific MO</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes.

The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked yearly. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to insure the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
