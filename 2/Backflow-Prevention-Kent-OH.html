<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
