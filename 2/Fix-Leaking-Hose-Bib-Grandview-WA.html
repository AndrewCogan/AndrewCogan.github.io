In most states, other than Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or business. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes.</p>
<p>In some cases, leakages can be sealed by welding or similar methods. Nevertheless, if leakages keep springing up in the exact same length of pipe, then it's very likely that you're handling a flaw in the pipe, which needs to be replaced. If you discover corrosion or rust on a pipe, a leak is just a matter of time. It's actually lucky if you find corrosion before a leak takes place, because it provides you time to have repiping done before you're faced with a flood in your home due to a leak.</p>
