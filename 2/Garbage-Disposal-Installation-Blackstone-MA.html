<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain tubes must have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space might be used to accomplish this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

Backsiphonage is backflow triggered by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply.

The assembly includes resilient, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
