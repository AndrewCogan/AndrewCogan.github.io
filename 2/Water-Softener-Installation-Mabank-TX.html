These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
