<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Hallandale FL</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
