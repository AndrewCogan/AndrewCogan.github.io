Soft water feels visibly smooth to the skin. It also makes your home simple to clean by lowering hard-water accumulation. High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water entering into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without correct pressure decrease.</p>
<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line indicates totally eliminating the whole toilet. So it's a. good time to think about getting a brand new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs. As you home ages the water taking a trip through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes good sense.

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to prepare, I generate a great deal of meals. We established a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are very happy that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company again and once again in the future.</p>
