Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
