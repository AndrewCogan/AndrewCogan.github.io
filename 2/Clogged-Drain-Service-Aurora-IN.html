The disposer system is heavy and can be awkward to navigate underneath the sink. Use a big bowl or other strong object to prop up the system as you place it. Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are effectively preserved.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
