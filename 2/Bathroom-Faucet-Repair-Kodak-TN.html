Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing business and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors typically include paying an application fee and passing a comprehensive company, law and building regulations examination. Some community colleges and technical schools offer contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for prospective plumbing business owners might include proof of financial trustworthiness, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
