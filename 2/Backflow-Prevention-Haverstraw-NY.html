The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to get away.
