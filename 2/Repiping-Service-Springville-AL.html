<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
