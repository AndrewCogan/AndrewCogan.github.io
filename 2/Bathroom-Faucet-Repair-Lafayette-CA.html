<p>There are different materials used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping some of the products are metal and possibly some plastic pipes.

Plastic pipes also have questionable joining techniques. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Formation (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.
