<p>Leakages can occur if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
