With this method, our service technicians make insertions or holes at both ends of the damaged sewer pipe. They then insert a brand-new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's path utilizing a hydraulic machine. This triggers the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a brand-new, more powerful, leak-resistant and extremely long lasting sewer pipe without having to dig up the old one initially.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the option typically comes down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is durable and less expensive than copper. PEX is easy to install, which means the cost of installation might be low also. There is some danger of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is uncommon. In basic, it's an affordable solution that will stand the test of time. We frequently advise this product, though it will depend.</p>
