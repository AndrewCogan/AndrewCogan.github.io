<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
