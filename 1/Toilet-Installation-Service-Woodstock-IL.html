<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Woodstock</h2>

<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method laid out above. Because the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
