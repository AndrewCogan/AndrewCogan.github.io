<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Exton PA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
