<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure.
