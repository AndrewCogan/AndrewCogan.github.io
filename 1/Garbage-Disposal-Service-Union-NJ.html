<p>As water heaters age, especially when they approach the decade mark, you may start to notice some issues. Any types of weird noises generally suggest trouble.

While gas models are less expensive to operate, they do need an existing gas line. The price tag of an electric hot water heater is typically lower, but it can be more expensive to run. Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat. Electrical Failures: Waste disposal unit are electrical and mechanical in nature, which is why faulty wiring or damaged electrical connections are a typical cause for a system that won't work correctly.</p>
