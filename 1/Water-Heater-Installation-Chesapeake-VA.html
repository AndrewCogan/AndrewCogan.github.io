<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection in between the bowl and the sewer line means entirely eliminating the whole toilet. So it's a. great time to consider getting a brand name brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
