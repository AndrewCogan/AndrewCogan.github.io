<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
