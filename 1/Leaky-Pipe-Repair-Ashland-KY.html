Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl).

<h3>Lavatory Faucet Repair in Ashland Kentucky</h2>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
