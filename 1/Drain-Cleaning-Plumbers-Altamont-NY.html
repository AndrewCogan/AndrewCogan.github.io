This device includes no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

Newer systems use computerized sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other essential metrics based upon your water use and therefore just regenerate when required. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
