<p>The cost depends on the size of the house and the number of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last expenses. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire combating, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
