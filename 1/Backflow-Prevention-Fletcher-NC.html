<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee. This is especially real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
