<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure occurs whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Waste disposal unit warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and ten years. Because the average life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to purchase a prolonged service warranty. Many warranties cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To avoid more malfunctions, homeowners need to keep up with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
