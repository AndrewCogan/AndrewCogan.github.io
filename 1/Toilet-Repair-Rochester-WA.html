<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on highly technical know-how and specialized equipment to identify the place of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the place of those leakages at which visible water may or might not have actually appeared.

For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
