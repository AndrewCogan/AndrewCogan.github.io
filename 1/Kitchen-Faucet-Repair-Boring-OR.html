Your home's area, obstructions, the range from your home to the main line, and local building regulations can significantly increase expenses, though they typically do not go beyond $2,000. In many cases, the gas company installs, owns, and maintains the gas line and gas meter up to your home.</p>
<p>The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, and so on.
