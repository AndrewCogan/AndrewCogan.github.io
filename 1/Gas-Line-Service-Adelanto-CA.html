We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction in between them? When it concerns the issue of difficult water, a standard water softener actually removes magnesium, calcium and silica ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as momentary solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
