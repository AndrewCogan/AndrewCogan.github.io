<p>Badly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. They responded quickly for my sewer leak. Jay B and Aaron scoped the task quickly and discussed the game plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me educated and persevered through extremely challenging sewer line clean-up and repair. I will recommend SW plumbing for any major repair work.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
