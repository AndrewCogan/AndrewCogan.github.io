<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
