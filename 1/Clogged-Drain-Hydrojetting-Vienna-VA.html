<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested every year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
