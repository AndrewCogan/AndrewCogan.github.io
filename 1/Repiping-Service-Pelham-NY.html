<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers become frustrating, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair.

<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.
