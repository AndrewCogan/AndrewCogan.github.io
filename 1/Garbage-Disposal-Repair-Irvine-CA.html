<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
