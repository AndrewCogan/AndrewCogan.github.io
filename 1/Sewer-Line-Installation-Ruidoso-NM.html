<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic tank and drain field. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then transition to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that should be.
