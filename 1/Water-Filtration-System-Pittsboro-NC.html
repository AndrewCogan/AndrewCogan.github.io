Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio home brings minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and parts. To avoid deterioration from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by bring in harmful materials. By having the anode rod checked routinely and replaced as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to get rid of tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure called Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that will not stay with any surface in your home, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters free of hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate caught ions.</p>
