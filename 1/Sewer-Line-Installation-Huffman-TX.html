<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
