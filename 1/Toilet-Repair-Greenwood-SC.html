<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
