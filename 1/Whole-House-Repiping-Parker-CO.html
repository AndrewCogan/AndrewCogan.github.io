<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it is essential to understand the typical causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most frequently in the winter.

If you haven't done so already, we suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to signal you of any possible gas leakages.</p>
