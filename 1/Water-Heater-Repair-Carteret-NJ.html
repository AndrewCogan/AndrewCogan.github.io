<p>Preparation to build a business that is lucrative enough to keep your life comfy? The pipe that links your sink to the main supply, contains water at high pressures.

<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Backpressure might occur when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping.
