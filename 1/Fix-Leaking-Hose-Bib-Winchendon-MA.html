<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
