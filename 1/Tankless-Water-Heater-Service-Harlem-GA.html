<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
