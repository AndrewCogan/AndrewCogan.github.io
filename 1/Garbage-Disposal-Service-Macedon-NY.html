<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
