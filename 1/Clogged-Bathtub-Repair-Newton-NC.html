By crushing food waste-- modern garbage disposals do not actually utilize blades - it's processed by water treatment centers where the small particulates are quickly removed and turned into strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to decrease the total expenses of treatment.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated each year. Likewise allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested every year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
