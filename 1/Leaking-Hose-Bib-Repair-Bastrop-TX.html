<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we show, check the directions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
