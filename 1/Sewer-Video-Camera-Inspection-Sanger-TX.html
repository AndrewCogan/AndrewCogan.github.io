When required, more recent units utilize electronic sensing units that monitor bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore just regrow. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
