Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is discovered, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a particular period of time is set aside to correct the issue.</p>
