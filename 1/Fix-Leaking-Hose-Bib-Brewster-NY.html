<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
