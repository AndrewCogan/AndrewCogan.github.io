Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are typically utilized in industrial plants, cooling towers, labs, laundries, swimming pools, lawn sprinkler systems, and fire lawn sprinkler. Pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve developed to close with the aid of a spring when water circulation stops.
