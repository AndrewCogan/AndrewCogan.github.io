I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
