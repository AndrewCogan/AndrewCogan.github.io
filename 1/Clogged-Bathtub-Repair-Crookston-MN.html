Technical instruction includes security, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. A lot of apprentices get in a program straight, but some begin as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
