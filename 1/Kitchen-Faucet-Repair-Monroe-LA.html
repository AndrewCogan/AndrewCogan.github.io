Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an important kitchen device in the majority of homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can handle almost any type of food waste, they are not indestructible.

Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
