<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Lexington KY</h3>
<p>Numerous older houses and companies have a system of pipes that are on its last legs. Did you know that slow, steady leaks often trigger more damage than an unexpected burst pipe? This is due to the fact that mold or mildew development has a chance to spread and establish over a longer amount of time. While repiping needs an upfront cost, it can conserve you from possible pricey water damage down the roadway. Learn more about pipe repair in Atlanta below.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
