<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested annually. Likewise allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an every year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested annually to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
