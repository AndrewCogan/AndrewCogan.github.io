<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes.

This is since homes are not effectively ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any potential gas leakages if you haven't done so already.</p>
