<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water in fact needs it. When required, newer units utilize electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regenerate. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
