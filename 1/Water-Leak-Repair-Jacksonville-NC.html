<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
