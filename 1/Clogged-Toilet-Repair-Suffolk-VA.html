<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to isolate health or nonhealth risks.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the intrinsic style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or fixed flow condition may cause problem dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.
