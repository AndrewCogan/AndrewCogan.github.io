<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
