<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
