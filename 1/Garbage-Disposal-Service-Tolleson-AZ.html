<p>The term difficult water" may sound like an oxymoron, but it's merely household water which contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They also are fairly undetected through smell or taste, however they can be harmful simply the same. Just like our trenchless services, we will first carry out pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
