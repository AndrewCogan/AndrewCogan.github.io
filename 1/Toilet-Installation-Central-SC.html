Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
