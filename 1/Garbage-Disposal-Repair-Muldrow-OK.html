<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
