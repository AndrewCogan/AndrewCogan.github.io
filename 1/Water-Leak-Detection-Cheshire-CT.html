<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
