<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Makawao HI</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home, this is one of the very first and main concerns that you need to ask yourself. The age of your home is a critical element to comprehend whether you must repipe your house.

If your house was built before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimum rates if your house was constructed decades prior to that.</p>
