Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
