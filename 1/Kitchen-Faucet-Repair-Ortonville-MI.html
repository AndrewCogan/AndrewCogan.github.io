Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.

<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide decades of defense. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to weaken in its performance.
