<p>When the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if needed, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
