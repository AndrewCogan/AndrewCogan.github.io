Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions.

The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as indicated by pressure assesses during inspection will be deemed to show the existence of a leak.</p>
