<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is necessary to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it might be not practical in lots of situations to install a pipe segment of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
