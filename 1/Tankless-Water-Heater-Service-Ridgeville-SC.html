It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>An rdc resembles a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it usually does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be geared up with test dicks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but ought to be used to isolate just nonhealth threats and is planned for usage only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>When there are fractures or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is recommended. Replacement of the line is advised if damage is serious.
