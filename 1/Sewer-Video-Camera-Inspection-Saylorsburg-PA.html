<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
