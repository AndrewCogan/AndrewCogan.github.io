These obstructions might have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have built up over time. Hydro jetting's advanced technology enables the procedure to be fast and efficient.

<p>Commercial kitchen garbage disposals can be found in several styles and horse power designs to manage a wide variety of volumes. Light responsibility garbage disposals are normally required in fast food dining establishments, corner store, delicatessens and office kitchens. Schools, health centers, and medium-sized dining establishments can usually utilize a medium responsibility design. Big dining establishments, hotels, factories and kitchen areas that deal with high volumes of waste will require a heavy duty commercial waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
