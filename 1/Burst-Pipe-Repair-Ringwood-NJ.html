Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
