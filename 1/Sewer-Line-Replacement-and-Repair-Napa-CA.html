<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
