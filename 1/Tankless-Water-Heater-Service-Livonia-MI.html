<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
