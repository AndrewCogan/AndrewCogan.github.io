<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
