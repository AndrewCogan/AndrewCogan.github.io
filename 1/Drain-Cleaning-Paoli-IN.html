<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. When required, more recent systems use digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason only regrow. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
