<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Waipahu HI</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested each year. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked each year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
