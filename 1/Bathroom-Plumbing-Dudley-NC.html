Water will release until the supply side pressure again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, free" salt ions are launched into the water.
