It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Lubrication might assist with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.
