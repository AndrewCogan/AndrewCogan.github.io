<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually discovered extensive usage since it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and operate individually of each other. A set of four test cocks enable the operator to examine the valves and make sure they are not being forced open by built up debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at expected functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
