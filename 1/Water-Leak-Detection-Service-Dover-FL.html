New meters should fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may require a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options.

Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.
