<p>Pipeline video inspection is a kind of telepresence utilized to aesthetically examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to figure out the condition of little diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

A bad plumber can be your worst problem in terms of problems that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
