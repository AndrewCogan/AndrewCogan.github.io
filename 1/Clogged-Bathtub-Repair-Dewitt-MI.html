Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
