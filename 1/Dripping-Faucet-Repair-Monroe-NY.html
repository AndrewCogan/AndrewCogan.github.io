These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply.
