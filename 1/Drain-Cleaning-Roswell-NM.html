In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
