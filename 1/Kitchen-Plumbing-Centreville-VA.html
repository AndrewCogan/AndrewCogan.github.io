<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
