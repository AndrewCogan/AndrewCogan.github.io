In addition, if an issue is fixed as soon as it is first noticed, it may not need more pricey repairs in the future. JEA's preferred supplier program is used to customers for their benefit in selecting a supplier who meets our requirements to test, repair, replace and install backflow preventers.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which might carry unclean water or other, dangerous compounds into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of situations that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City supply of water lines. Backflow can likewise bring water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
