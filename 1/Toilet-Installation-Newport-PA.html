There are 2 fundamental kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by using 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets use the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to clear the bowl.

<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing skills if you're fairly inexperienced.

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
