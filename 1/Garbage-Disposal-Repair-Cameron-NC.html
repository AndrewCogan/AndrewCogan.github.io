It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.
