<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
