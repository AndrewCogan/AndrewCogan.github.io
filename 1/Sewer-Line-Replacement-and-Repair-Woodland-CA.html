These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
