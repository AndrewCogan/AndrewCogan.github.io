Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
