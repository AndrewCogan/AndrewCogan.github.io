Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
