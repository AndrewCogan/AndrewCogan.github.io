<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are becoming increasingly more typical, as both consumers and makers seek new ways to save water. Double flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or strong. We have actually all heard the old saying, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down."
