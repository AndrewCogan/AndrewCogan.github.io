<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
