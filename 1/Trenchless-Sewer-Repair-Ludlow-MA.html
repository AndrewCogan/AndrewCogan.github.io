<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
