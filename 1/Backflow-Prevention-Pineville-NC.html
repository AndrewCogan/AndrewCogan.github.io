<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system. Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
