In a different drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house. A great method to reduce the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Rapidly and efficiently getting rid of leftover potato peels, fruit skins and lots of other types of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into great particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
