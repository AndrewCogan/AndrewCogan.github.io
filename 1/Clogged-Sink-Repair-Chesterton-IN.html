Contact Pittsburgh's Matt Mertz Plumbing, Inc., to pipe brand-new jobs or repipe older houses. Reach us at (412) 365-4263 today.

<p>Changing the ring that seals the connection in between the bowl and the sewer line means completely removing the entire toilet. So it's a. great time to think about getting a brand name new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless-steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for several years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water features are thought about a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be suggested on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>The term hard water refers to water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the country you're in, but a lot of frequently consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I like to cook, I produce a lot of meals. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and once again in the future.</p>
