<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Avondale PA</h3>
