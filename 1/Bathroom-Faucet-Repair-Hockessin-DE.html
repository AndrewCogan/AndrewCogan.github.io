<p>Toilets are one of those plumbing components that we often consider approved-- they're lasting, durable, and quite regularly there for you when you need them. Also, toilets take up such a large part of your bathroom that many people are starting to take them into account when upgrading their bathroom style options. But that doesn't imply toilets are best-- gradually they will need to be repaired when something fails, and they might even ultimately need to be replaced.
