<p>2. Potassium Pellets can be used as a sodium replacement and is advised for those who are viewing their sodium intake. Potassium pellets are compatible with any water softener and can be purchased at much of the very same stores where sodium pellets are sold for about the very same cost. In many cases, a natural gas line might be covered if it is ruptured. This kind of scenario might occur if a contractor is dealing with an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line. A house owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an utility company, it might be covered.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
