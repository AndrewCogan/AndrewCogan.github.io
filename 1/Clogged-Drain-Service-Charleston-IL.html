<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
