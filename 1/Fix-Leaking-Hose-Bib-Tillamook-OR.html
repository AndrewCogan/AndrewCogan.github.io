<p>Natural Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg odor associated with gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you need to take to safeguard yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
