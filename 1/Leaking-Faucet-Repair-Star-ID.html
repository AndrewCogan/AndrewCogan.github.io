<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
