<p>Natural gas is an important utility we use every day to keep our houses and workplaces warm, our showers hot, and to cook our food. With the everyday usage of gas, it is reasonable it is understandable that over time a leak is bound to occur. When a leak appears, it is important to know the indications, signs, and how to act. Remember to take safety measures when dealing with gas appliances, utilize the previously mentioned signs to determine potential leakages, and call a plumber to have your gas lines regularly inspected and kept.</p>
<p>Rather, call one of our professional plumbers to come and repair your drain for you. Our Greenville drain cleaning technicians will supply you with the service you need to rapidly get your plumbing back in working order. We have advanced equipment to accurately identify what plumbing solution will be needed, including drain snakes, rooters, and cams. Sometimes a plumbing problem is more than simply a leaky faucet - often it's a pipe issue. If you have actually discovered your pipes making odd or loud noises (among the most common is a hammering sound), call one of our sink repair experts. We'll take a look at the situation and if we find that your pipes are old, we might recommend a replacement. If we find that it's merely a leak or a fitting issue, we'll repair it as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
