<h3>Clogged Drain in Wayzata Minnesota</h2>
<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is frequently described. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electric timer that flushes and recharges the system on a regular schedule.</p>
