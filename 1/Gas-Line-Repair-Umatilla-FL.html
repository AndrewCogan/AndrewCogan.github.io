They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements.
