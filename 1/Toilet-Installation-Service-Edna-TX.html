<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they usually take place in the most affordable open drain. This kind of issue is generally the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not detect the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this problem due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
