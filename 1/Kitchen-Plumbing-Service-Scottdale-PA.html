<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
