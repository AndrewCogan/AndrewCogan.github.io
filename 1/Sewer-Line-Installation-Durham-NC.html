The effectiveness of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing.

If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>It is an excellent concept to have your pipes examined every 5 years to see how they're holding up. When pipes begin to go, it is essential to have them switched out right now to avoid leakages and pipe bursts, both of which can do costly damage to your home. Keep in mind that pipes do not have a "busy season," they see regular usage year round. Schedule service today and start keeping a record of their maintenance history if you can't remember the last time you had your pipes looked at.</p>
