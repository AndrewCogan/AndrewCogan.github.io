If health or ecological reasons necessitate restricting salt, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be suitable. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
