These minerals should be filtered out of the unit so they don't create a sediment barrier on the burner and disrupt water heater efficiency. Hot water heater filtration can flush out these minerals and avoid a breakdown. The burner should also be checked regularly to ensure that the flame is blue with a yellow pointer. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will impact your water heater's performance, and it could release carbon monoxide gas fumes into your indoor air.</p>
