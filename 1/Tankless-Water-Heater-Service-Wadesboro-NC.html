<p>Salt intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking.

This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regrowth procedure can be scheduled automatically with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>Obstructions are quickly avoided with a few key actions. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible.
