Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way could have conserved her a great deal of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure.

Plastic supply pipes have actually ended up being progressively common, with a variety of fittings and materials used.</p>
