Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
