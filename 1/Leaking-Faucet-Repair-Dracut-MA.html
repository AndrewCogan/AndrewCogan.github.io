Something as unimportant as moving a gas clothing dryer for any purpose whatsoever can damage the gas pipe. Gas lines which are versatile are prone to crimping and leaking, others made from inappropriate, low-grade material likewise end up being brittle quickly and rust away, triggering a severe leak.
