Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
