If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>

<p>A recently set up hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, however it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate significantly for households with a high need for hot water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
