To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, gather equal parts of vinegar and baking soda regularly. For regular cleaning, you'll simply need about one-half cup of each. Let the mix sit for a few minutes before running some warm thin down the drain. You can also utilize lemon juice for the exact same function.</p>
