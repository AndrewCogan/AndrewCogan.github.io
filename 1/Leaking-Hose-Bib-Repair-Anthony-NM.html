<p>In local water supply systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>

This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential across the other, producing a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leakage. Test cocks, or little ball valves, make it possible for the attachment of testing equipment that evaluates whether the double check assembly is practical.</p>
