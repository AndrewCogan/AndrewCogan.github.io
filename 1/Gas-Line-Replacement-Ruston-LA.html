He added that a base system purchased through him costs around $1,100. The service call and installation of my brand-new hot water heater cost $1,300. The math discusses all of it.</p>

Smaller individuals and households might do much better with an electric water heater, or an on-demand tankless" hot water heater as described in the area below.</p>
