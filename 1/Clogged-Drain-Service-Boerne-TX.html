<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
