The salt water tank is essentially a tank for sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is combined with water during the brine refill and regeneration cycles. This brine (a concentrated solution of seawater) is drawn back into the mineral tank throughout the regeneration phase to replenish the softener bed. The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and must be renewed regularly to ensure adequate softening form the device.</p>
<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is particularly true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
