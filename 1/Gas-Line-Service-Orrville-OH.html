<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, bathtub, or sink) can be remedied quickly if the clog is simple and shallow. For the majority of clogs you'll just need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you may also need to employ a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>

Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the system upside down and shake it out).</p>
