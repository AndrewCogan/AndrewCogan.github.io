The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
