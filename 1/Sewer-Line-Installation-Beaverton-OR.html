<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system.
