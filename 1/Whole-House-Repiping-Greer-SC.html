<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Greer SC</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines because pressure is lost during these events.</p>
<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our house. I will constantly use them and ask for George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were timely and offered great rates for what we needed done. I extremely suggest this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>When the flush valve in the tank fails or uses out, another irritating issue is. If you hear the toilet running continuously or regularly you probably need the valve or float replaced.  Stopping working to repair a running toilet can result in wasted water and an extremely high water bill. Water in Florida is expensive so don't delay-- get a running toilet fixed. Fixing it may be best if your water heater is only a couple of years old and just has a minor problem. You might want to consider repairing your water heater and scheduling routine maintenance if the cost of replacing broken parts is low-cost.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
