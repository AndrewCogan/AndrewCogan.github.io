The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away.
