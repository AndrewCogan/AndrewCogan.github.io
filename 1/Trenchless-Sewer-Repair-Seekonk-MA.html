A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
