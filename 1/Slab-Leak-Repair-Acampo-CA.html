<p>This is a completely valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, of course, as essential as your hot water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nonetheless, it adds a reasonable quantity of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably little cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris.
