The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
