<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
