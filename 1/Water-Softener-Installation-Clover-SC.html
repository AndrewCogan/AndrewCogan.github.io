<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak immediately and often those leaks come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
