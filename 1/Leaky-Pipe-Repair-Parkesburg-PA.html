<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
