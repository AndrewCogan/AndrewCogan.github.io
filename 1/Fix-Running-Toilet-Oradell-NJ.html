<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>For commercial centers including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a warm water heater can have a huge influence on day-to-day operations and must be avoided whenever possible.

If required, a licensed plumber can not just find that cause of the issue however safely repair or replace your main sewer line.</p>
