<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Collierville TN</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>Faulty parts: If you have an electrical hot water heater, a defective thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot light may head out, resulting in little or no warm water. In basic, traditional water heaters are expected to last 7-10 years with correct maintenance. Check the age of the existing water heater if you're moving into a new house. You don't wish to move into a new house only to find out you're going to need to make a significant plumbing repair in just a year or two.</p>
