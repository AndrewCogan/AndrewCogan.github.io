<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are typically used in industrial plants, cooling towers, laboratories, laundries, swimming pools, lawn sprinkler systems, and fire sprinkler systems. When water circulation stops, pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve designed to close with the help of a spring.

The assembly consists of durable, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked each year to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
