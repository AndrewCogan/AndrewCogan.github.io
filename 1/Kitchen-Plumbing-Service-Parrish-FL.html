It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
