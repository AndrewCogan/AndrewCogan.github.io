<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
