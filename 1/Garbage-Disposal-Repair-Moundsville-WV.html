The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, iron, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. Most of these plastic pipe systems will end in claims. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are frequently cheaply made with little quality assurance by a verity of overseas companies.
