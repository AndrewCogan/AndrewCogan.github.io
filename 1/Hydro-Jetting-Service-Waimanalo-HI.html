This procedure involves covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and corrosion within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the inside of the pipe and the product flowing through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The professional, Kenny, was polite, professional and useful! He asked me to look at the camera with him then explained my choices without trying to oversell me!
