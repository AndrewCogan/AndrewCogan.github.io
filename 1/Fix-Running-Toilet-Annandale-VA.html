<p>Little Leaks - A leak does not always indicate that your hot water heater's going, it might simply be condensation. But it likewise might indicate that your tank welds or pipe fittings are used. If this is the case, a plumber is required. When many people consider plumbers, they normally call them for water pipe concerns.
