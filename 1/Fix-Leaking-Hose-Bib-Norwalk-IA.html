Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue.
