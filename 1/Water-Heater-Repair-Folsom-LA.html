The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
