In the ion exchange process, salt ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like damp sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>You'll need to have the backflow valve checked every year going forward if you're having a new lawn irrigation system installed.

Register for the Plumbing Inspection Notice mailing list to receive updates for Master Plumbers straight in your inbox.

<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is amongst the best ways to stay ahead of the video game. This detailed inspection can uncover severe problems with your sewer line you might not see until it's too late.

<p>Backflow preventers must only be repaired when the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
