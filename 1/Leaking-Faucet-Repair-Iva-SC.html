A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater. To ensure that we are offering high-quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out hot water heater replacements.
