<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to likewise be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.

We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
