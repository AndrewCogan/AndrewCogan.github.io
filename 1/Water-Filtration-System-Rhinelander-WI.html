<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this short area of pipe prior to it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The required length of the drip leg differs. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs in time.

<p>Main sewer repair involves comprehensive excavation, supporting supporting walls, removing and passing on pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover. Service lines which stem from personal property and feed into the main line are a normal area for leaks or breaks. Off-road tasks outside the right-of-way need a great deal of manual work for excavation and hauling products, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
