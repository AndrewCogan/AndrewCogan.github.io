Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and particular other metal cations in hard water The resulting soft water requires less soap for the exact same cleaning effort, as soap is not lost bonding with calcium ions. Soft water also extends the life time of plumbing by eliminating or lowering scale accumulation in pipes and fittings. Water softening is typically accomplished using lime softening or ion-exchange resins however is increasingly being achieved using nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home (constructed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
