<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it might be impractical in numerous circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
