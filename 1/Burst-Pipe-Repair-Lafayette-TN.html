<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may effectively belong to your project requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which brings in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout the house. Tankless innovation makes sense. As soon as you comprehend the benefits, it's easy to see why house owners in Charlotte, North Carolina, pick these products over standard water tanks.
