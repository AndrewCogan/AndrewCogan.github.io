In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any remaining pollutants.</p>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
