<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Really often the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Merely place a long, strong, wood manage (a broom handle will be adequate) into the opening.

If so, find the reset switch on the bottom of the system. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog persists.</p>
