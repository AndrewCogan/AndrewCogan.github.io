<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
