<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I love to cook, I produce a great deal of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.

If it clogs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
