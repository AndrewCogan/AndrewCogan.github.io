<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) needs plumbing contractors to get a plumbing license prior to replacing a backflow or installing preventer. Your hot water heater. The pro will next examine your hot water heater. With your water heater, she or he is taking a look at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).
