Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
